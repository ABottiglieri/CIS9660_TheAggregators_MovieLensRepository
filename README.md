#### 2. Description of the Project
MovieLens is a streaming service that offers a variety of award winning movies on hundreds of internet connected devices. You can watch as much as you want and whenever you want. 

#### 3. Identifying The Business Problem
In the last couple of years, MovieLens has seen a drastic decrease in user engagement as well as record high percentages of user churn. The company’s user base went from 1,000 users down to 700 users, and movies watched decreased from 20+ movies watched per month to less than 10 movies watched per month per user.

To keep the company from losing viewership and profits, they have hired a team of data scientists to find ways to increase user engagement.

By analyzing the available data, our team intends to identify the clusters of users and create a recommendation engine that makes personalized recommendations to users based on the user’s historical movie watching and ratings data, as well as the historical movie watching and ratings data of similar users. We will also make movie recommendations based on movies with similar traits as those previously watched (i.e. genre, production company, or actors).
